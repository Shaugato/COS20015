Fundamental of Data Managements
This is a summary of learning outcome:


1.Set theory is a branch of mathematical logic that studies sets, which are collections of objects.
2.Data types, schema, and validation describe the structure of data and ensure that it adheres to certain constraints or requirements.
3.Ternary logic introduces a third truth value, often used to deal with null values in data.
4.Data can be represented in various ways, including tabular, hierarchical, and relational formats.
5.Data processing involves transforming and analyzing data, while data retrieval involves querying and retrieving data from a database or other data source.
6.Searching, sorting, and indexing are common operations in data processing and retrieval, with various algorithms used to perform these operations.
7.Text processing involves manipulating and analyzing text data, with various tools and techniques used for this purpose.
8.Importing, exporting, and transforming data involve moving data between different applications or systems and converting data from one format to another.
9.Transactions ensure the consistency and integrity of data when multiple users access and modify it concurrently.
